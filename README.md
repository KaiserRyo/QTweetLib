QTweetLib v.0.5 originates from https://github.com/minimoog/QTweetLib

Overview:
===================
- Uses QJson library by Flavio Castelli for parsing JSON responses
- JSON parsing is done in multithreaded way using QThreadPool
- User Streams support is not fully completed (fetches responses correctly,
  JSON parsing is not full implemented)

Modifications:
=======================
- QTweetLib encapsulated in a Cascadesâ„¢ for BlackBerry 10 project
- Calls to the Twitter API are made using HTTPS
- Calls to the Twitter API have been updated to 1.1 for rollover in March 2013
- New components with simliar design patterns to existing QTweetLib API calls have been added:
  - RESTAccountUpdateProfile: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile.json"
  - RESTAccountProfileBanner: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile_banner.json"
  - RESTAccountUpdateProfileImage: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/update_profile_image.json"
  - RESTFollowersId: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/followers/ids.json"
  - RESTFriendshipExists: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1/friendships/exists.json?"
  - RESTFriendshipLookup: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/friendships/lookup.json"
  - RESTIsFriend: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/friendships/lookup.json"
  - RESTLocalTrends: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/trends/closest.json?"
  - RESTStatusUpdateMedia: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update_with_media.json"
  - RESTTrends: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/trends/place.json?"
  - RESTUsersReportSpan: Call interface to:
    "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/users/report_spam.json"
  - RESTPhotoPost: Convenience class that uploads a photo to the Twitter server
  for the logged-in user.
  - RESTCustomGet: This class adds extra flexibility to the developer by allowing
  custom API calls to be made. It takes a QUrl in parameter and returns a
  QVariant in its callback. This mechanism could be used to make all Twitter
  API calls, however, the user must assemble the parameters himself/herself
  as well as disassemble the generic QVariant returned from the callback.
